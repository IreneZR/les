# Local Elimination Solver (LES)

Copyright (c) 2012 Oleksander Sviridenko

## What is LES?

LES is a library for solving a class of mathematical problems called [integer
linear programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_linear_programming)
(ILP) problems and its variants with help of local elimination algorithms (LEA).

## What is it for, anyway?

Many real [discrete
optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_optimization) problems
(DOPs) from [OR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) applications
contain a huge number of variables and/or constraints that make the models
intractable for currently available solvers. Usually, DOPs from applications
have a special structure, and the matrices of constraints for large-scale
problems have a lot of zero elements (sparse matrices), and the nonzero elements
of the matrix often fall into a limited number of blocks. The block form of many
DO problems is usually caused by the weak connectedness of subsystems of
real-world systems.

One of the promising ways to exploit sparsity in the constraint matrix
of DO problems are LEAs, including local decomposition algorithms,
nonserial dynamic programming (NSDP) algorithms.

## Installing on Ubuntu

Tested on Ubuntu 11.10 x86. Please,
[let me know](https://github.com/d2rk/les/issues), if it does not
work for you.

First, of all, you need to install prerequisites:

    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ git make

LES also requires some [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries.
They can be installed [manually](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html#easy-build-and-install)
or from repository:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

Note, on this moment (maybe temporary) LES depends on [framework
SYMPHONY](https://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY). See INSTALL_SYMPHONY.md to
learn how to install and setup it proprly.

Next, get the sources and build it:

    git clone git://github.com/d2rk/les.git
    cd les
    make

## Getting Started

Add path to LES library for your projects:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/somewhere/les/lib/
