"""The interaction graph of the discrete optimization problem (DOP) is called an
undirected graph :math:`G=(X,E)`, such that:

1. Vertices :math:`X` of :math:`G` correspond to variables of the DOP;
2. Two vertices of :math:`G` are adjacent if corresponding variables interact.

Interaction graph of variables is also called constraint graph.
